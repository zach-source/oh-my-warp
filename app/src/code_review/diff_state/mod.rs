//! Unified diff state module.
//!
//! [`DiffStateModel`] is an enum that provides a unified API over local and remote models.
//! It holds one of [`LocalDiffStateModel`] or [`RemoteDiffStateModel`] and dispatches
//! operations to whichever is active.
//! All consumers should use `DiffStateModel` rather than accessing sub-models directly.
